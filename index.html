            <p>Hi, this is Sanjida. I have an associate's degree in web design. As the learning is ongoing. Learning and working in web development takes effort and time. So you're never really done with the learning part. It can take years to master the skills of a good web developer. And I'm trying really hard to get to the top.</p>

            <h3>Become a web developer</h3>
            <p>Web developers design and create websites. They are responsible for the look of the site. They are also responsible for the site's technical aspects, such as its performance and capacity, which are measures of a website's speed and how much traffic the site can handle. Becoming a web developer, is not an easy task to do. But if only you keep working hard, you would get to the successs.</p>

            <h3><span class="orange-highlight">2021 - Present | Pro level Web Dev</span> </h3>
            <p>A full stack web developer is a person who can develop both client and server software. In addition to mastering HTML and CSS, he/she also knows how to: ... Program a server (like using PHP, ASP, Python, or Node) Program a database (like using SQL, SQLite, or MongoDB). I wouldn't necessarily say that being a full stack developer is more difficult than other roles -- you don't have to be a super genius to do it. You just need to be able to recognize, understand, prioritize and apply software patterns. It's something any motivated engineer can do.</p>

            <p>I joined web development course in 2020. Then the journey started abnd never stopped. I learned basic html, css, node, mongoDB. I wouldn't necessarily say that being a full stack developer is more difficult than other roles -- you don't have to be a super genius to do it. You just need to be able to recognize, understand, prioritize and apply software patterns. It's something any motivated engineer can do. </p>
